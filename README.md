A simple plugin that adds a keyboard shortcut for 'Toggle Constrain Proportions'. This plugin is similar to others but this one is made to be compatible with the new plugin methods introduced in Sketch 39. And this plugin is not bundled with any other plugins which you'll probably never useâ€¦

## Install with Sketch Runner

With Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` command and search for `Toggle Constrain Proportions`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).

## Install manually

1. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/ErikFontanel/sketch-toggle-constrain-proportions/releases)
2. Double click on the `toggleconstrainproportions.sketchplugin` file
3. Done

## How to use
1. Select an object
2. Run this plugin and watch the lock change from ðŸ”’ to ðŸ”“ (and vice versa).

### Note
As of 1.1 this plugin does not come with a default shortcut anymore since it's impossible to prevent duplicate shortcut conflicts and because [Sketch Runner](http://bit.ly/SketchRunnerWebsite) makes it easy to run commands.
