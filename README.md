A simple plugin that adds a menu item so you can configure a keyboard shortcut for the 'Toggle Constrain Proportions' command. This plugin is similar to others but this one is made to be compatible with the new plugin methods introduced in Sketch ~~39~~45. And this plugin is not bundled with any other plugins which you'll probably never useâ€¦

## Install with Sketch Runner

With Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` tab and search for `Toggle Constrain Proportions`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).

## Install manually

1. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/ErikFontanel/sketch-toggle-constrain-proportions/releases/latest)
2. Double click on the `toggleconstrainproportions.sketchplugin` file
3. Done

## How to use
1. Select an object
2. Run this plugin and watch the lock change from ðŸ”’ to ðŸ”“ (and vice versa).

### Note
- As of 1.1 this plugin does not come with a default shortcut anymore since it's impossible to prevent duplicate shortcut conflicts and because [Sketch Runner](http://bit.ly/SketchRunnerWebsite) makes it easy to run commands.
- If you're using Sketch 44 or older, use [version 1.1](https://github.com/ErikFontanel/sketch-toggle-constrain-proportions/releases/tag/1.1).
